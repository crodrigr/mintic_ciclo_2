# Association, Composition and Aggregation in Java

![](https://github.com/crodrigr/mintic_ciclo_2/blob/main/recursos/img/Associatn.png)

## Association

Association is relation between two separate classes which establishes through their Objects. Association can be one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, many-to-many. 

In Object-Oriented programming, an Object communicates to other Object to use functionality and services provided by that object. Composition and Aggregation are the two forms of association.

### Ejemplo en java de una relación asociación. 

#### Java program to illustrate the concept of Association
```java
// Java program to illustrate the
// concept of Association
import java.io.*;
 
// class bank
class Bank
{
    private String name;
     
    // bank name
    Bank(String name)
    {
        this.name = name;
    }
     
    public String getBankName()
    {
        return this.name;
    }
}
```
#### Java employee class
```java
// employee class
class Employee
{
    private String name;
     
    // employee name
    Employee(String name)
    {
        this.name = name;
    }
     
    public String getEmployeeName()
    {
        return this.name;
    }
}

```
#### Java Association between both the classes in main method
```java
// Association between both the
// classes in main method
class Association
{
    public static void main (String[] args)
    {
        Bank bank = new Bank("Axis");
        Employee emp = new Employee("Neha");
         
        System.out.println(emp.getEmployeeName() +
               " is employee of " + bank.getBankName());
    }
}
```
