# Association, Composition and Aggregation in Java

# 1 .Association

Association is relation between two separate classes which establishes through their Objects. Association can be one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, many-to-many. 

In Object-Oriented programming, an Object communicates to other Object to use functionality and services provided by that object. Composition and Aggregation are the two forms of association.

In above example two separate classes Bank and Employee are associated through their Objects. Bank can have many employees, So it is a one-to-many relationship.

### Ejemplo en java de una relaci贸n asociaci贸n. 

#### Java program to illustrate the concept of Association
```java
// Java program to illustrate the
// concept of Association
import java.io.*;
 
// class bank
class Bank
{
    private String name;
     
    // bank name
    Bank(String name)
    {
        this.name = name;
    }
     
    public String getBankName()
    {
        return this.name;
    }
}
```
#### Java employee class
```java
// employee class
class Employee
{
    private String name;
     
    // employee name
    Employee(String name)
    {
        this.name = name;
    }
     
    public String getEmployeeName()
    {
        return this.name;
    }
}

```
#### Java Association between both the classes in main method
```java
// Association between both the
// classes in main method
class Association
{
    public static void main (String[] args)
    {
        Bank bank = new Bank("Axis");
        Employee emp = new Employee("Neha");
         
        System.out.println(emp.getEmployeeName() +
               " is employee of " + bank.getBankName());
    }
}
```
# 2. Aggregation

It is a special form of Association where:  

- It represents Has-A relationship.
- It is a unidirectional association i.e. a one way relationship. For example, department can have students but vice versa is not possible and thus unidirectional in nature.
- In Aggregation, both the entries can survive individually which means ending one entity will not effect the other entity

In this example, there is an Institute which has no. of departments like CSE, EE. Every department has no. of students. So, we make a Institute class which has a reference to Object or no. of Objects (i.e. List of Objects) of the Department class. That means Institute class is associated with Department class through its Object(s). And Department class has also a reference to Object or Objects (i.e. List of Objects) of Student class means it is associated with Student class through its Object(s). 

It represents a Has-A relationship.

#### Java program to illustrate the concept of Aggregation

    String name;
    int id ;

    {
         
        this.name = name;
        this.id = id;
        this.dept = dept;
         
    }
}
 
```

```java

Objects. It is asoociated with Department

    Institute(String instituteName, List<Department> departments)
    {
        this.instituteName = instituteName;
        this.departments = departments;
    }
     
    // count total students of all departments
    // in a given institute
    public int getTotalStudentsInInstitute()

            }
        }
        return noOfStudents;
