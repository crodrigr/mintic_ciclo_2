# Association, Composition and Aggregation in Java

# 1 .Association

Association is relation between two separate classes which establishes through their Objects. Association can be one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, many-to-many. 

In Object-Oriented programming, an Object communicates to other Object to use functionality and services provided by that object. Composition and Aggregation are the two forms of association. 

![](https://github.com/crodrigr/mintic_ciclo_2/blob/main/recursos/img/example-associatn.png)

In above example two separate classes Bank and Employee are associated through their Objects. Bank can have many employees, So it is a one-to-many relationship.

### Ejemplo en java de una relación asociación. 

#### Java program to illustrate the concept of Association
```java
// Java program to illustrate the
// concept of Association
import java.io.*;
 
// class bank
class Bank
{
    private String name;
     
    // bank name
    Bank(String name)
    {
        this.name = name;
    }
     
    public String getBankName()
    {
        return this.name;
    }
}
```
#### Java employee class
```java
// employee class
class Employee
{
    private String name;
     
    // employee name
    Employee(String name)
    {
        this.name = name;
    }
     
    public String getEmployeeName()
    {
        return this.name;
    }
}

```
#### Java Association between both the classes in main method
```java
// Association between both the
// classes in main method
class Association
{
    public static void main (String[] args)
    {
        Bank bank = new Bank("Axis");
        Employee emp = new Employee("Neha");
         
        System.out.println(emp.getEmployeeName() +
               " is employee of " + bank.getBankName());
    }
}
```
# 2. Aggregation

It is a special form of Association where:  

- It represents Has-A relationship.
- It is a unidirectional association i.e. a one way relationship. For example, department can have students but vice versa is not possible and thus unidirectional in nature.
- In Aggregation, both the entries can survive individually which means ending one entity will not effect the other entity

In this example, there is an Institute which has no. of departments like CSE, EE. Every department has no. of students. So, we make a Institute class which has a reference to Object or no. of Objects (i.e. List of Objects) of the Department class. That means Institute class is associated with Department class through its Object(s). And Department class has also a reference to Object or Objects (i.e. List of Objects) of Student class means it is associated with Student class through its Object(s). 

It represents a Has-A relationship.

### Ejemplo en java de una relación agregación. 

#### Java program to illustrate the concept of Aggregation
```java
// Java program to illustrate
//the concept of Aggregation.
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;
 
// student class
class Student
{
    String name;
    int id ;
    String dept;
     
    Student(String name, int id, String dept)
    {
         
        this.name = name;
        this.id = id;
        this.dept = dept;
         
    }
}
 
```

```java
/* Department class contains list of student
Objects. It is associated with student
class through its Object(s). */
class Department
{
     
    String name;
    private List<Student> students;
    Department(String name, List<Student> students)
    {
         
        this.name = name;
        this.students = students;
         
    }
     
    public List<Student> getStudents()
    {
        return students;
    }
}
```

```java
/* Institute class contains list of Department
Objects. It is asoociated with Department
class through its Object(s).*/
class Institute
{
     
    String instituteName;
    private List<Department> departments;
     
    Institute(String instituteName, List<Department> departments)
    {
        this.instituteName = instituteName;
        this.departments = departments;
    }
     
    // count total students of all departments
    // in a given institute
    public int getTotalStudentsInInstitute()
    {
        int noOfStudents = 0;
        List<Student> students;
        for(Department dept : departments)
        {
            students = dept.getStudents();
            for(Student s : students)
            {
                noOfStudents++;
            }
        }
        return noOfStudents;
    }
     
}
```

```java
// main method
class GFG
{
    public static void main (String[] args)
    {
        Student s1 = new Student("Mia", 1, "CSE");
        Student s2 = new Student("Priya", 2, "CSE");
        Student s3 = new Student("John", 1, "EE");
        Student s4 = new Student("Rahul", 2, "EE");
     
        // making a List of
        // CSE Students.
        List <Student> cse_students = new ArrayList<Student>();
        cse_students.add(s1);
        cse_students.add(s2);
         
        // making a List of
        // EE Students
        List <Student> ee_students = new ArrayList<Student>();
        ee_students.add(s3);
        ee_students.add(s4);
         
        Department CSE = new Department("CSE", cse_students);
        Department EE = new Department("EE", ee_students);
         
        List <Department> departments = new ArrayList<Department>();
        departments.add(CSE);
        departments.add(EE);
         
        // creating an instance of Institute.
        Institute institute = new Institute("BITS", departments);
         
        System.out.print("Total students in institute: ");
        System.out.print(institute.getTotalStudentsInInstitute());
    }
}
```

# 3. Composition 

![](https://github.com/crodrigr/mintic_ciclo_2/blob/main/recursos/img/example-associatn5.png)

Composition is a restricted form of Aggregation in which two entities are highly dependent on each other.  

- It represents part-of relationship.
- In composition, both entities are dependent on each other.
- When there is a composition between two entities, the composed object cannot exist without the other entity.
Let’s take the example of the Library. 

![](https://github.com/crodrigr/mintic_ciclo_2/blob/main/recursos/img/example-associatn6.png)

In above example, a library can have no. of books on same or different subjects. So, If Library gets destroyed then All books within that particular library will be destroyed. i.e. book can not exist without library. That’s why it is composition. 

```java
// Java program to illustrate
// the concept of Composition
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;
 
// class book
class Book
{
 
    public String title;
    public String author;
     
    Book(String title, String author)
    {
         
        this.title = title;
        this.author = author;
    }
}

```
```java
// Library class contains
// list of books.
class Library
{
 
    // reference to refer to list of books.
    private final List<Book> books;
     
    Library (List<Book> books)
    {
        this.books = books;
    }
     
    public List<Book> getTotalBooksInLibrary(){
         
       return books; 
    }
     
}

```
```java
// main method
class GFG
{
    public static void main (String[] args)
    {
         
        // Creating the Objects of Book class.
        Book b1 = new Book("EffectiveJ Java", "Joshua Bloch");
        Book b2 = new Book("Thinking in Java", "Bruce Eckel");
        Book b3 = new Book("Java: The Complete Reference", "Herbert Schildt");
         
        // Creating the list which contains the
        // no. of books.
        List<Book> books = new ArrayList<Book>();
        books.add(b1);
        books.add(b2);
        books.add(b3);
         
        Library library = new Library(books);
         
        List<Book> bks = library.getTotalBooksInLibrary();
        for(Book bk : bks){
             
            System.out.println("Title : " + bk.title + " and "
            +" Author : " + bk.author);
        }
    }
}

```

## Aggregation vs Composition 

Dependency: Aggregation implies a relationship where the child can exist independently of the parent. For example, Bank and Employee, delete the Bank and the Employee still exist. whereas Composition implies a relationship where the child cannot exist independent of the parent. Example: Human and heart, heart don’t exist separate to a Human
Type of Relationship: Aggregation relation is “has-a” and composition is “part-of” relation.
Type of association: Composition is a strong Association whereas Aggregation is a weak Association.
